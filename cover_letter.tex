%		\lettersection{About Me}
		%%% Generic Intro
		I am writing to offer my recommendation for Matt's admission into the Information Systems Security Master's Degree program at the University of Denver. 
		I have known Matt for four months now as a teammate and have thoroughly enjoyed working with him.
		I believe that he will show himself to be an excellent student capable of building lasting relationships with faculty and students alike while proving himself technically proficient and a hard worker.
		
		In the brief time I have known Matt, he has shown an intense fervor for cybersecurity, often spending his free time to work through online courses that expand his knowledge information systems. 
		With a master's degree in computational chemistry, I recognize Matt's zeal for learning and applying his knowledge in a way consistent with, if not surpassing, most graduate students I have known. 
		I see his potential as a bright student who will always bring something to the table, whether as a critical analysis of or a constructive addition to whatever the subject may be.
		
		I offer my utmost support for Matt's application to Information Systems Security Master's Degree program at the University of Denver. 
		Thank you for your time and consideration. 
		Please feel free to reach out to me if you have any questions regarding his character, work ethic, or any other qualities related to his program.
